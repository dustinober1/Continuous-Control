# Technical Report: Solving Continuous Control with DDPG

## Summary

This report describes the successful implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to solve the Unity ML-Agents Reacher environment. The agent achieved an average score of **30.11 over 100 consecutive episodes**, solving the environment in **112 total episodes**.

## Learning Algorithm

### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

DDPG is an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that operates over continuous action spaces. It combines ideas from DPG (Deterministic Policy Gradient) and DQN (Deep Q-Network).

#### Key Components:

1. **Actor-Critic Architecture**: 
   - Actor μ(s|θ^μ): Deterministically maps states to actions
   - Critic Q(s,a|θ^Q): Estimates the value of state-action pairs

2. **Experience Replay Buffer**: 
   - Stores experiences (s, a, r, s', done)
   - Randomly samples mini-batches to break temporal correlations
   - Buffer size: 1,000,000 experiences

3. **Target Networks**: 
   - Separate target networks for both actor and critic
   - Soft updates: θ' ← τθ + (1-τ)θ'
   - Provides stability during training

4. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise**: 
   - Temporally correlated noise for exploration
   - Parameters: μ=0, θ=0.15, σ=0.1 (reduced from 0.2)

### Hyperparameters

```python
BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e6)    # Replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 32           # Minibatch size (reduced from 128)
GAMMA = 0.99              # Discount factor
TAU = 1e-3                # Soft update of target parameters
LR_ACTOR = 1e-4           # Actor learning rate
LR_CRITIC = 1e-4          # Critic learning rate (reduced from 1e-3)
WEIGHT_DECAY = 0          # L2 weight decay
UPDATE_EVERY = 20         # Network update frequency
NUM_UPDATES = 5           # Number of updates per step
```

Key adjustments from default values:
- **Reduced batch size** (32 vs 128) for faster training
- **Balanced learning rates** (both 1e-4) for stable convergence
- **Reduced noise sigma** (0.1 vs 0.2) for less aggressive exploration

## Neural Network Architectures

### Actor Network
```
Input Layer (33) → FC1 (400) → BatchNorm → ReLU → 
FC2 (300) → ReLU → FC3 (4) → Tanh
```
- Input: 33-dimensional state vector
- Hidden layers: 400 and 300 units
- Output: 4-dimensional action vector (normalized to [-1, 1])
- Batch normalization after first layer for stability

### Critic Network
```
State Input (33) → FC1 (400) → BatchNorm → ReLU → 
Concatenate with Action (4) → FC2 (300) → ReLU → FC3 (1)
```
- State processed through first layer before action concatenation
- Hidden layers: 400 and 300 units
- Output: Single Q-value estimate
- Batch normalization for input stability

### Weight Initialization
- Hidden layers: Uniform distribution scaled by fan-in
- Output layers: Uniform(-3e-3, 3e-3)
